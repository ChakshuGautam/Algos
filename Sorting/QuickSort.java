 * The current implementation is the in place quick sort.
 *
 * Quick sort lives upto its name and is the fastest sort out there.
 *
 * "On average, mergesort does fewer comparisons than quicksort, so it may be better when complicated comparison
 * routines are used. Mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be favored for using sort()
 * to merge several sorted arrays. On the other hand, quicksort is often faster for small arrays, and on arrays of a
 * few distinct values, repeated many times." â€” http://perldoc.perl.org/sort.html

 * A good discussion to look at is here. I am presenting the answer here.
